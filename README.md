# Serasa Allow Me Application

This is the `Serasa Allow Me` application, built using React, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest and Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) testing. The project also uses `pnpm` as the package manager for dependency management.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18.x or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Version 7.x or higher)

To install `pnpm`, you can run:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run the application.

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathmartins2/serasa-allowme.git
cd serasa-allowme
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

Use `pnpm` to install the project's dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the development server locally, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

This will start a development server using `Vite` on `http://localhost:5173/` by default. You can access the application by opening your browser and navigating to that URL.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist` folder.

## Running Tests

### Unit and Integration Tests

Unit and integration tests are written using `Vitest`. To run these tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests with Playwright

**Important:** To run the E2E tests, the application must be running. Ensure the development server is running with `pnpm run dev` before starting the E2E tests.

To run the E2E tests, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

This will run the Playwright tests in headless mode. If you want to run the tests in non-headless mode (with a visible browser), you can modify the Playwright configuration or run the tests with the `--headed` flag:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --ui
```

### Running All Tests (Unit, Integration, and E2E)

If you want to run **all tests**, including both unit tests and E2E tests, first ensure the development server is running by executing:

```bash
pnpm run start
```

Then, in a separate terminal window, you can run:

```bash
pnpm run test && pnpm run test:e2e
```

This command will run the unit tests and then run the E2E tests.

### Viewing Playwright Test Report

After running the E2E tests, you can view the test report by running:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright show-report
```

This will open the HTML report generated by Playwright, allowing you to inspect test results.
